# C\C++ Skip List Implementation

This is C89 implementation of the data type described in [William Pugh's paper](https:www.epaperpress.com/sortsearch/download/skiplist.pdf) with widths.

> Skip lists are a data structure that can be used in place of balanced trees.
> Skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than strictly enforced balancing
> and as a result the algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are
> much simpler and significantly faster than equivalent algorithms for
> balanced trees.

Using widths allows for efficient random access.

Although this library will work with C and C++, if you perfer fancy C++ objects you can check out [my first implementation of skip lists](https://github.com/Garfield1002/jhr_skip_list)

## üí° Why use Skip Lists ?

Skip Lists allow insertion, deletion, random access and search in O(log n) on average (and O(n) in worst case).
Skip lists are a simple data structure that can be used in place of balanced trees for most applications and are much less daunting.

## üìö Usage

**This library is written in standard C89 for portability.**

The idea behind single-header file libraries is that they're easy to distribute and deploy because all the code is contained in a single file.
The .h file acts as its own header files, i.e. it declares the functions and classes contained in the file but no code is getting compiled.

So in addition, you should select _exactly_ one C\C++ source file that actually instantiates the code, preferably a file you're not editing frequently.
This file should define `JRSL_IMPLEMENTATION` to actually enable the function definitions.

You can check out [example.c](https://github.com/Garfield1002/jrsl/blob/master/example/example.c) for some sample code.
